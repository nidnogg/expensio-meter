## About
expensio-meter is a simple web app built for trying to figure out if something is expensive or not when travelling, according to values you know about

## How to Use
For a better idea, check out the [live demo](https://nidnogg.github.io/expensio-meter/). The idea is that you select your home country, add increasing values of things that you find cheap, moderately cheap and so forth.

Then, add a country to compare and you can get a better idea of how values scale. You can then save that value to `localStorage` for later use.

## Setup
Most of the dev environment was bootstrapped using `bun`. It is recommended to use, but not really essential. Several installations used `pnpm` as well.

First, run 
```bash
bun install
# alternatively 
# pnpm install
```

Then, 
```bash
bun dev
# alternatively 
# pnpm dev
```
